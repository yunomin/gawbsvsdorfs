    - "Welcome to Gobs Vs Dorfs! In this game you play as one of the two eponymous
      forces of the Mighty Mountain in their attempt to strip the mountain of its
      valuable gold. You win by being the side with the most gold, or with the last
      home base standing by the time the gold in the mountain runs out or you run
      your opponent out of Dodge. What do both sides use gold for? Why the acquisition
      of more gold of course! What is a value driven economy elsewise.\r\n\r\nYou
      interact with you environment by clicking around to access various actions.
      This tutorial will offer two suggestions per action until we take the training
      wheels off. Though you\u2019ll only be taking one suggestion at a time we recommend
      you read both so you can better learn and understand the hows and whys of the
      game\u2019s systems.\r\n"
    - "Deciding what to do can generally be viewed as deciding how you want to play,
      either more or less aggressively. \r\n\r\nFor this first action if you\u2019d
      like to play aggressively select the move action on the action bar by clicking
      the button. After that you click on where you want your forces to move from
      and then clicking where you want them to move to, selecting however many you
      specifically want to move along the way. You\u2019ll select the middle tile
      as your destination as you\u2019re trying to gain control of the powerful mushroom
      lake where all building outputs are substantially increased.\r\n\r\nWhile each
      tile will only show one physical Gob or Dorf each model is just a representation
      of a number of your forces shown as the number above their head. Both sides
      start with six forces but that can be expanded by increasing the amount of
      mushrooms you receive each turn.\r\n"
    - "If you\u2019d like to play more defensively we\u2019d recommend building a
      gold mine in the space with two empty slots next to your base. This will allow
      you to begin pumping out more money to further increase your infrastructure.
      You can hover your mouse over buildings in the build action or on the map to
      learn more about them. You can also look at the top corners of your screen
      to see how both players incomes are looking.\r"

    sentences:
    - "Your second action will be the last one you take before your opponent begins
      their turn so keep that in mind, because they\u2019ll be able to respond with
      two actions as well.\r\n\r\nIf you went with the aggressive move last action
      you\u2019ll now be gaining control of the mushroom lake. Control is how you
      build and maintain the income from buildings you\u2019ve erected, control is
      also how movement is determined as you need your allies either in the place
      you\u2019re moving from or to to successfully move. Any player can take control
      of any building as long as they either take control of the tile of their choice
      when they have more forces there than their opponent or have just won a battle
      against their opponent in that tile. You\u2019re going to try to ensure your
      control of the powerful mushroom lake.\r"
    - "If you elected to build a gold mine instead you\u2019ll be focusing on receiving
      a bonus from that gold mine early by using the Harvest/Overtime action to immediately
      receive the yield from all building on one tile, thus giving you a boost to
      your financial production and bringing you closer to defeating your enemies!"

    sentences:
    - "During your opponent\u2019s turn they will be able to perform the same actions
      you have available to you, whether you\u2019re playing hotseat multiplayer
      or against the computer you\u2019re on an even playing field against your opponent.
      Remember that you either win by amassing the most gold by the time the mountain
      runs out, or by destroying your opponent\u2019s base through battle. Battle
      is an action that highly rewards the attacking player over the defending one,
      so be sure to strike first if you\u2019re worried about your opponent. Mushrooms
      factor heavily into combat and we\u2019ll be discussing them at the start of
      your turn."

    sentences:
    - "Your turn has just started again! You should notice in the upper corner how
      your resources may have just gone up depending on what you\u2019ve previously
      built. If you built a gold mine you\u2019ll have the resources needed to build
      a mushroom farm and if you\u2019ve taken the mushroom lake you\u2019ll also
      be able to build a mushroom farm.\r\n\r\nThe mushroom farm will allow you to
      field more forces to the Mighty Mountain, or hold onto spare mushrooms in order
      to give any troop on the map a boost in one battle. At the start of your turn
      is when you\u2019ll be able to select where you\u2019ll be building more troops,
      or if you\u2019re running low on mushrooms where you\u2019ll be removing your
      troops.\r\n"
    - "Regardless, you\u2019ll be building a mushroom farm on either the tile where
      you already have a gold mine, or on the mushroom lake if you have control of
      it. This will allow you to field more troops."

    sentences:
    - "After building that mushroom farm you\u2019ll be more equipped to maintain
      control of Mighty Mountain! This will be the last tutorial screen you\u2019ll
      see so be sure to read it carefully. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve built both a gold
      mine and mushroom farm you should try using the harvest/overtime action again
      to receive your additional income. As stated earlier you should click the action,
      then click the tile you\u2019d like to make go into overtime. From here you
      should have a strong enough economy to begin building more troops and more
      buildings as you expand across the map. Your objective should be to mine the
      mountain dry before your opponent.\r"
    - "If you\u2019ve built a mushroom farm on mushroom lake you should do one of
      two things. If there are no enemy troops on mushroom lake, you should move
      your troops from one of your two map corners to the center by clicking on the
      move action; then the moving from location; then the moving to location and
      move all of your forces there.\r\n\r\nIf there are enemies on the mushroom
      lake, you should try to battle them because when you battle attackers have
      a distinct advantage, hitting about two thirds of the time as opposed to half
      the time. Select the battle action then select your location for battle and
      confirm that you want to fight, as once randomness is introduced it can\u2019t
      be taken back. The outcome of the battle will determine how you may want to
      play for the rest of your game! \r\n"
    - "If you do well, then you should try to amass more of your forces to the center
      mushroom lake and then try to push into your opponent\u2019s territory: remembering
      that you need to take control of their territory as you move in and to not
      leave your own base vulnerable. If you did powerfully you should try to defend
      your base and begin slowly moving to reclaim some of the adjacent territory
      to your base. Regardless, your end goal is to conquer your opponent\u2019s
      base. \r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy your time with Gobs Vs Dorfs! Do your best
      to show the denizens of Mighty Mountain who\u2019s the boss!\r\n"
